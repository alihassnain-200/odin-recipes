    <p>This is the best coffee cake I've ever had. The pumpkin spice gives it the perfect flavor, especially in the fall and winter seasons. Goes perfect with your morning cup of coffee. Top with icing or powdered sugar.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>cooking spray</li>
<li>1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar, or as needed</li>
<li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
<li>¾ cup butter, at room temperature</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with cooking spray. Coat with cinnamon sugar.</li>
<li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs, blending 1 at a time. Add pumpkin pie spice and vanilla extract and combine.</li>
<li>Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Alternate adding flour mixture and sour cream to egg mixture a little at a time, starting and ending with flour mixture.</li>
<li>Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together for topping in a small bowl. Pour 1/3 of the cake mixture into the prepared pan. Top with 1/2 of the brown sugar mixture. Repeat once more.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before transferring to a plate.</li>
    </ol>
