    <p>I got this biscuits and gravy casserole recipe at a church potluck. All the flavors blend really well. I've made it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So far every time I've served it, I haven't had any leftovers.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>cooking spray</li>
<li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands!)</li>
<li>1 (1 pound) bulk pork sausage</li>
<li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
<li>6 large eggs</li>
<li>½ cup milk</li>
<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 ½ cups cold water, or more as needed</li>
<li>1 (1.5 ounce) package pork gravy mix</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
<li>Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish with biscuits.</li>
<li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Scatter sausage over biscuit layer and top with 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
<li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined; pour over cheese layer.</li>
<li>Mix water and gravy mix together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until gravy is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes, adding more water for a thinner gravy. Pour gravy over egg layer. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese over casserole.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are fluffy and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
